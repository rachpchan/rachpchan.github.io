# CPSC362 Group E Project

This is the beginning of our employee management system program. 

We will be developing an employee management system that serves as a way to simplify ways to work together as a team. Attributes and IDs will allow the site to redirect the user based on their level at the company. The project will be able to implement an employee management system that tracks and manages employee information.  The goal for this project is to provide an easy way to manage employee data. Organization is TBD, possibly attribute or attribute-based, which may allow access rights or certain privileges based on employee role. General employee information would also be collected and organized. There could possibly be roles or positions added to the system in order to better define hierarchy and access. A possible system could be supervisor with employees being assigned to a supervisor. This project will also store vital employee info.

Employee Attributes to collect: First Name, Last Name, Social Security, Address, Phone Number, Emergency Contact(Goes with Phone Number), Role

Currently, the program will the in the form of a website accessible by employees and managers. Employees and managers will have separate login pages. 

Both employees and managers will be able to login and access their information. Managers would also be able to make changes to employee information. An option to register new employees will be included in the manager interface.
